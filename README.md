Aurora Template
===============

### A free HTML5 template for personal and commercial usage.

It was created for my [personal portfolio](http://serafin.io/?utm_source=Aurora-Template&utm_medium=GitHub-Readme&utm_campaign=Freebie) (but never used) and now I'm releasing it for free.

Edit and use this template as you want, except selling or crediting it as your own.


It would also be cool if you could share this.

# Usage & Editing



## How to edit stylesheets?

Although it isn't recommend you can directly edit /style/css/global.css or overwrite it with your styles.

If you know Sass and Gulp you shouldn't have a problem with editing provided stylesheets.

## How to edit favicon?

Just use [Real Favicon Generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/) and overwrite current favicon.

# Support

I'm kind of busy so I can't provide support. The code isn't that complicated, you probably shouldn't have any problems with this template.
