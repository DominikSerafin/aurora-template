aurora-template
===============

### A free HTML5 template for personal and commercial usage.

It was created for my [personal portfolio](http://serafin.io/?utm_source=Aurora-Template&utm_medium=GitHub-Readme&utm_campaign=Freebie) (but never used) and now I'm releasing it for free.

Edit and use this template as you want, except selling or crediting it as your own. It would also be cool if you could share this. Did I forgot to mention that it also includes small easter egg? It does.
