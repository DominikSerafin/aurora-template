Aurora Template
===============

### A free HTML5 template for personal and commercial usage.

It was created for my [personal portfolio](http://serafin.io/?utm_source=Aurora-Template&utm_medium=GitHub-Readme&utm_campaign=Freebie) (but I never used it) and now I'm releasing it for free.

Edit and use this template as you want, except selling or crediting it as your own.


It would also be cool if you could share this.




# Features

- Contact Form in PHP
- Cool Project Showcase
- Responsive, Fast and Mobile Friendly
- Vector Icons and Font Awesome
- Sass and BEM Modular Stylesheet (with SourceMaps)



# Usage

## How can I change the e-mail address where contact form should send messages?

Just edit line 55 in /php/contact_form.php

```
    $to_email = "mail@example.com";

```

## Contact form doesn't work :(

Make sure your server is able to execute PHP scripts and you've set a valid e-mail address.


## How to edit stylesheets?

Although it isn't recommend you can directly edit /style/css/global.css or overwrite it with your styles.

If you know Sass and Gulp you shouldn't have a problem with editing provided stylesheets.


## How to edit favicon?

Just use [Real Favicon Generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/) and overwrite current favicon.


# Support

I'm busy most of the time so I can't provide support. The code isn't that complicated, you probably shouldn't have any problems with it.
